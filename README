NAME

SYNOPSIS
      use Term::ReadPassword::Win32;
      while (1) {
        my $password = read_password('password: ');
        redo unless defined $password;
        if ($password eq 'flubber') {
          print "Access granted.\n";
          last;

          print "Access denied.\n";
          redo;
        }
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module lets you ask the user for a password from the keyboard just
    as Term::ReadPassword.

    Using Term::ReadPassword is a good way to make password prompts, but it
    doesn't work with ActivePerl under Windows. So I wrote this module.

    You can use this module under Windows or Unix. If you use this under
    Windows, Win32::* modules are required. If you use this under Unix, this
    acts as a wrapper to Term::ReadPassword.

    The Term::ReadPassword::Win32::read_password function is almost same as
    Term::ReadPassword::read_password function.

    The first and second parameters are just same. The first one is a prompt
    message, and the second one is timeout value.

    The third parameter is different from Term::ReadPassword::read_password.

    If the third parameter is 0, Ctrl+C will be entered into the input
    buffer just as any other character.

    If the third parameter is 1, the input operation is terminated when the
    user types Ctrl+C or Esc.

    If the third parameter is 2, the input operation is terminated when the
    user types Esc. If the user types Ctrl+C, the program may be terminated.

    If the user types Ctrl+U, the input buffer will be cleared.

BUG
    Multibyte characters are not treated properly. (When you want to delete
    a multibyte character, you must type BackSpace more than once.)
